Creating a model that classifies twitter replies.

# Background
Being a user of Twitter for many years now, it has definitely become my favourite social media platform. Most of this is due to how everyone popular in the world has some Twitter presence and how the lives of many are broadcasted through Twitter. Due to this nature of Twitter though, it makes it very easy for not so savoury opinions to get broadcasted to the world. One thing this results in is the creation of subtwitters which polarizes people and increases hostility. One place that I've seen the most hostility on is the reply section of Tweets. From experience, it's hard to read comments to even positive and wholesome tweets without someone projecting their hostile opinion. Thus, the main motivation behind this project is to see whether this is something that occurs frequently on Twitter or if it is just my selectional bias.
